# TypeScript
 ## Why do we need TypeScipt .
   Few years ago , the assumption of JavaScript is that it is a client side programming language.
   For this purpose , the programmer should learn the two languages i.e Java and JavaScript .
   Early days ago , the developer thought that the JavaScript might work as a server side language. 
   But there are  many complexities in JavaScript ( like oop) . To resolve this complexity , we use the TypeScript
   In order to write the JavaScript in an accurate manner is called TypeScript .
 ## Installation
  Firstly we should download the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
  After downloading , we test whether node is download or not. To run the command ,
     
     node -v 
  Then you should check npm is installed or not . To check it , we run the command ,
  
     npm -v 
  later , you should install typescript in the core .To  install typescript run the command:-
  
     npm intall typescript@latest -g
After this we should add the tsconfig.json . In it we set the conversion properties of  JavaScript are decided.We make it by the followig command:-

    tsc --init
Then , we install the package.json file which help us to install more packages from npm . Sometime ago, we don't get input from user in command prompt . To face this problem , someone contribute the node package manager .There are many packages in npm that helps us to solve the problem . We make it , by the follwing syntax:-

  <br><b> npm init -y

### Why we need package.json 
- We need it when we install some packages and export our packages to the npm.
Then , we install the depencies(means we install the package) ,For this run the following command:-
   <br><b> npm i @types/node -D
