# Object Oriented Programming 
 It is a type of programming tht basis on object.
 ## Classes
The method of making object is called classes . Classes are the blue print(map) of the object.
We make a class by the following syntax 
 
   class class-name{}

Class has a property to define the key value pair. To use the class we write a keyword class . 
To use method , we write . after function name  . Class is used as data type.
To put the value optional we use ! sign before: in the class.
To perform any work we make a method is called function in the Example
### Public keyword
It is used to public the attribute . To use it , we can change the value.
### Private 
It is used to private the attribute. We cann't change the value in it.
### New 
New Keyword prform three task as follows:-
- It makes a empty object.
- It makes the empty object of this .
- It returns all the values of class . 
- It makes empty constructor .
### constructor
Each class has an builtin constructor that construct the object. Constructor has a parameter.
In this function this is  used to access the parameter  . 
If we don't make the constructor then type engine is automatically made the empt constructor.
It is not allowed to construct the multiple contructor.We see Example
### this
It is used to access the property and method in the object . 
### Advantage
- It's used to make the thousand of object by putting the Argument inside the parenthesis of function. 
## History  
Before the TypeScript , We write a code of lines  without any sequence that create a complexity , that is difficult to understand us . To resolve the issue TypeScript gives us four principle to write a code . These Principles are as follows:-
- abstract.
- encapsulation.
- inheritance.
- polymorphism.
