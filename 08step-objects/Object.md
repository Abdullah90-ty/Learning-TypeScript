# Object 
Object is a set of key value pair that are separated with comma.
This an unprimitive datatype . Except primitive data type is called object.
## Advantage 
They are used to store the  multiple values in a single variable.
## key
key is a name of property of an object.
## Nested Object
We also put object inside an object is called nested object.
## Accessing property
We also access property by the following syntax as follows:-

          object-name.property-name
Another way as follows:-

          object-name["property-name"];
## Type Alias
We also give the type by using type keyword . We put the type inside it. We also give type inside the type.
It's example is writtren in the [Givng type](https://github.com/Abdullah90-ty/Learning-TypeScript/blob/main/step8-Objects/Example01.ts)
## Using object to declare variable
 Using Object Before Using Object , We also declare variable with type in the example   .
 We use multiple object then use in the new object.[Using object to declare variable](https://github.com/Abdullah90-ty/Learning-TypeScript/blob/main/step8-Objects/Example02.ts)

### Methods
The object in which the functions are used are methods.

### Important 
We Use type inside a type to different the property of an Object.

### Passing Option type 
We also put the optional type by using ? before colon sign otherwise the typescript create an error.
### union of type 
We also use union of type . We use it when we have a condition.The Example of union of type.[Union of type](https://github.com/Abdullah90-ty/Learning-TypeScript/blob/main/step8-Objects/Example04.ts)
