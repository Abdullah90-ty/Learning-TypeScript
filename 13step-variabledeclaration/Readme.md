# Declaration of Variable
A variable can be declared by three ways as follows:-
- var
- let 
- const
## Block Scope
Block Scope means variable can be used only in curly braces.
let and const are both block scope.
## let
The value of variable in the let can also be change or reassign .
## const
In which the value of variable or array can not be assign .
But the value of array can be change by method (like push(),pop()).
