# TypeScript
 ## Why do we need TypeScipt .
   Few years ago , the assumption of JavaScript is that it is a client side programming language.
   For this purpose , the programmer should learn the two languages i.e Java and JavaScript .
   Early days ago , the developer thought that the JavaScript might work as a server side language. 
   But there are  many complexities in JavaScript ( like oop) . To resolve this complexity , we use the TypeScript
   In order to write the JavaScript in an accurate manner is called TypeScript .
 ## Installation
  Firstly we should download the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
  After downloading , we test whether node is download or not. To run the command ,
     
       <br> <b>node -v </b> </br>
  Then you should check npm is installed or not . To check it , we run the command ,
  
       <br><b>npm -v </b></br>
  later , you should install typescript in the core .To  install typescript run the command ,
       <br><b> npm intall typescript@latest -g
